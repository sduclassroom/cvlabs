# Final Project Ideas

If you'd like to implement an idea from this list contact me during your lab. It is possible for 2-3 students to do similar projects but with different approaches and algorithms (why not?)

1. ### Jumping-rope
Application for gym. Video from camera is processes to count how many times a body-builder has jumped. Some simple gesture recognition may be implemented to start/reset/pause counting etc.

2. ### Exam Paper Checker
Invent a new format for multiple choice-single answer test. Add extra features like QR code for variant etc.

3. ### Counting Door Guard
An application that counts how many people are currently inside a building. It would be very useful for SDU building surveillance.

4. ### Football Statistics
Application that automatically counts various football statistics like possession of ball, meters run etc. Requires testing video of SDU football match from a high position and fixed cameras...
May be started with small teams of 2-3 persons.

5. ### Printing on the screen with eyes
Device a protocol/alphabet for disabled people, who can not move their arms and can not speak as a result of apoplexy, that would allow them to type some text to communicate...

6. ### Printing text on the screen with gestures
Similar to previous project idea but for people who can move their arms but can not speak...

7. ### Car License Plate Detection/recognition
Automatic Number Plate Detection and then Recognition is a well studied topic, but still there is space for improvement. First step is the detection of number plate on a car. Invent an algorithm of your own that would detect license plate location on a car at SDU entrance gate (шлагбаум)
